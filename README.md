# Exercism Solutions Backup

This repository contains my personal solutions to exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/).  
I use it as a backup and version control system for tracking my progress while practicing coding challenges.

## 📂 Structure
Each folder represents a programming language track from Exercism.  
Inside each track folder, you’ll find my solutions to the individual exercises.


## 🚀 Purpose
- Keep a backup of all completed Exercism exercises.
- Track my learning journey and coding progress over time.
- Practice version control with Git and GitHub.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
These solutions are **for reference and backup purposes only**.  
If you are solving Exercism exercises, I highly recommend trying to solve them on your own first before looking at other solutions.

## 🛠️ Tools
- [Exercism CLI](https://exercism.org/docs/using/solving-exercises/working-locally)
- Git & GitHub for version control

⭐ If you are also practicing on Exercism, keep learning and have fun coding!
